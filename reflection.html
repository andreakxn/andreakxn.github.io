          <h3>1. OU Daily Article</h3>
             <p> I had a short but meaningful stint at the OU Daily. I first joined their News Academy freshman year, where I learned the ropes of journalism practices and reporting. As a freshman who had yet to have any experience with journalism, it was really eye-opening and. This article was written in my first semester of sophomore year, and it is one of multiple articles that were published under my name. Working in the OU Daily let me bring the information I learned in class and apply it to a real-life scenario in the newsroom.

          <h3>2. Broadcast Package Script</h3>
             <p> I had the opportunity to take a broadcast class in the summer of 2019. Initially, I found the format of broadcast journalism hard to get used to as it was quite foreign to me, an online journalism student. This was the first broadcast package script I wrote from just video clips and soundbites. I was proud of myself for doing as well as I did in that class, between juggling a research internship and taking the class in my home country, Singapore, instead of in the US.

                 <p>When I got the chance to choose an elective, instead of going for something familiar and journalism-related, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try something new. While I was familiar with psychology research, I wanted to experience other types of research fields. Not knowing what to expect, I enrolled in the PR reserach class. It has been a really fascinating semester, as we got to work with a real client organization in Norman, the United Way of Norman. We got to conduct focus group interviews and surveys, and essentially create a research report from scratch. I should note that this report, while individually written, would not be possible without the collaboration of my teammates who played a part in interviewing three out of the four key publics individuals, and transcribed them for analysis in this report.

                 <p>I've always wondered about the behind-the-scenes of a broadcast news program. <em>Sure</em>, I knew about the script, but I wondered how the stories were pieced together, and what takes precedence over what. After learning the ins-and-outs about news programming, I had the opportunity to try to piece together my own evening news program, and while it was challenging, it was a very enjoyable process to learn and create my news program from scratch.

                 <p>For my practicum, as I had already had my turn at newsroom journalism at the OU Daily, I wanted to try something new. Growing up, I've always enjoyed creative writing, though I felt that I wasn't <em>that</em> great. When I realized I could take short stories with Prof. Mel Odom as a practicum, I jumped at the chance. This is one of the many stories I've written in Prof. Odom's class, and I can feel my writing improve with his feedback each week. This story is about a fortune teller in Brooklyn who has a difficult choice to make for the young couple who came to see her&hellip;

                 <h3>6. Academic Writing</h3>
                 <p>Throughout my time at OU, I took a myriad of classes ranging from astronomy to music to humanities of the ancient year, which is where this paper was from. This was written back during my junior year, where one of the topics we briefly covered was the Black Death. When we were given a chance to explore this topic further in different aspects, I chose to explore how the Black Death affected art in that period of history. Suffice to say, I learnt a great deal about this morbid subject, and was able to utilise critical thinking and literature review skills in order to put this paper together.

                 <p>This short story was also part of my practicum with Prof. Mel Odom. One thing I appreciated was that he had us do peer reviews with each other, so we got to be on the other side of the page and experience editing as well as writing. In addition, his prompts were wacky and forced us to think out of the box. For example, in this story, a boy, Dylan, steps off his time-machine after having traveled thirty years. He lands in the year 2021 and is astounded by what he sees around him.

                 <p>This blog is a short example of my ability to write in concise yet attention-grabbing paragraphs suitable for online lifestyle articles about topics such as travel. I am a big travel aficionado, and having the opportunity to write this for a class gave me a chance to stretch my informative writing skills beyond journalism-related writing itself. In addition, writing about what I was passionate for made this assignment extra meaningful.

                 <p>I am a double major in Psychology/Journalism. In my PSY 3114 - Research Methods course, we learned how to conduct psychological studies from top to bottom. For our final project, we had to conceptualize and come up with our own research studies from scratch. Since Brooklyn Nine-Nine was my favorite TV show at the time, I decided to compare attitudes towards police officers before and after half the research subjects watched excerpts of the show, with the other half watching a clip from "The Good Place" as a control. The process from start to finish was one of the most enriching learning experiences, and I learned how to translate research methods learned in the classroom into an actual study.

For this research paper, us students were both the subjects and the researchers. This gave me quite a unique and more well-rounded perspective to help me write the paper.

                 <p>I completed a Research Assistantship in Summer 2019 under the direction of Prof. Yow Wei Quin of the Singapore University of Technology and Design. This presentation highlights my time and takeaways from the three-month long assistantship. More information about the lab can be found <a href="https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~quin/" target="_blank"> here</a>. I worked on optimizing and pilot testing an intervention app for seniors diagnosed with age-related cognitive disorders like dementia and Alzhemier's.
