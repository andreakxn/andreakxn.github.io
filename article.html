            <h3>An Introduction to the World's Worst Website EVER</h3>
          
          </div>
          
          
           <p id="first" >Someone, somewhere, someday, had the bright idea one day to take the <strong>worst</strong> elements in web design and combine them all into one page. <a href="https://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/">This</a> is the result.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p id="second">First of all, the website looks like it was designed in 2003. The copious amounts of WordArt reminds me of Microsoft Office that was in use like, last century. The website links to other very <em>random</em> sites that have <strong>absolutely</strong> no connection to it whatsoever. That being said, it also can be argued that there is zero point in this website except to make an example of terrible website design.</p>
         
            <br>        
          
        <p id="third">Other crappy design elements of this website include the weird and wacky pictures littered seemingly at random across the site. Also, the creator of this site has infuriatingly horrific spelling. He's probably never heard of spellcheck in his life. Or maybe he had a first grader build it for him. We will probably never find out. There are many, <strong>MANY</strong> other things wrong with this page but I will not get into them.</p>

          <p>While doing my "research" on this subject, I came across a website that may have been the most obnoxious one I have found yet. Before you click on the link below, please make sure that your headphones volume is not anywhere near 100%. Also, you might want to save your work. I hope you like cat pictures.</p>
