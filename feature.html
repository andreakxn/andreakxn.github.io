             <p>For decades, Native languages was shrouded in secrecy, mostly passed down from elders to the younger generations. As the world modernized and tribal communities shrunk, these languages faced the prospect of extinction. Then along came Mosiah Bluecloud.</p>

                 <p>Competing with bigger tribes that employed professional grant writers meant that as the Kickapoo tribe’s language director, Bluecloud was not able to get much funding.</p>

                 <p>Instead, the Kickapoo language department worked with ‘wrap funds’, or leftover money from what the tribe’s casinos used. Bluecloud pointed out that the tribe’s language department aspires to use the <a href="https://aicls.org/programs/https-aicls-org-wp-content-uploads-2020-01-aicls-master-apprentice-program-invoice-2020-pdf/" target="_blank"> Master-Apprentice</a> language learning method to teach language.

             <div class="feature-para">
             
                 <p>“The more speakers you get in it, the faster the learning process. (sighs) It’s expensive though. It’s expensive. And all the big tribes are doing it. The Chickasaws, the Cherokees, everyone is doing (sic) Master-Apprentice. I wanted my tribe to do it, but we can’t do it off of wrap funding. So yeah that’s my biggest obstacle, it’s just funding.”</p>
             
             </div>
             
             <div class="feature-para">
             
                 <p>	Bluecloud also mentioned that the COVID-19 pandemic had affected Native communities and language acquisition. For about a year, tribe members that interacted each other every day had to stay apart, which was hard on the tight-knit communities. </p>
             </div>
             <div class="feature-para">
             
                 <p>		However, there was a positive side to things. Bluecloud said that the rapid normalization of online learning meant that distance language learners and tribal members could once again be part of the community. </p>
             </div>
             <div class="feature-para">
             
                 <p>		“Tribal members that were in California and Washington and Florida and miles away from Oklahoma, they were brought into the fold of language learning. Before, nobody was trying to teach things online, really. There was no online classes. If you wanted to learn a language, you come to the community, you visit the elders, you find your place and come to ceremonies.” </p>

They are where they’re at but they’re still Kickapoo, they’re still Shawnee and still Sauk.”  </p>
